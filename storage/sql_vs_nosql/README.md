# SQL vs NoSQL Comparison

| **Aspect**             | **SQL (Relational)**                                                                 | **NoSQL (Non-Relational)**                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Model**         | Structured, table-based with fixed schemas and relationships                        | Flexible data models (document, key-value, column-family, graph)                          |
| **Schema**             | Rigid; must be predefined with strict structure                                     | Schema-less or flexible; allows dynamic and unstructured data                             |
| **Scalability**        | Vertical scaling (scale-up)                                                         | Horizontal scaling (scale-out) across distributed nodes                                   |
| **Consistency**        | Strong consistency with ACID transactions                                           | Eventual consistency, though tunable in some systems (e.g., MongoDB)                      |
| **Query Language**     | SQL (standardized and powerful for complex queries)                                 | Varies (e.g., MongoDB query language, Cassandra Query Language)                           |
| **Transaction Support**| Full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)                           | BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent); some support ACID in limited contexts |
| **Performance**        | Optimized for complex queries and relationships, slower for large-scale writes      | Optimized for high-throughput reads/writes, especially in distributed systems             |
| **Use Cases**          | Best for structured data and applications needing strong consistency (e.g., financial systems, ERP, CRM) | Best for unstructured/semi-structured data and large-scale distributed systems (e.g., big data, real-time analytics, social media) |
| **Scaling Challenges** | Difficult to shard or partition across servers                                      | Built to shard and distribute data easily                                                 |
| **Data Integrity**     | High; enforces strong data integrity through constraints and relationships           | Varies; integrity is often managed at the application level                               |
| **Joins and Relationships** | Supports complex joins between tables and foreign key relationships          | Relationships are either embedded (documents) or handled differently (e.g., graph databases) |
| **Examples**           | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server                                                | MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Redis, Neo4j                                                |
