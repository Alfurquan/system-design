## Why Graphs?

Graph DBs are ideal for **modeling and querying relationships**:

- In relational DBs, relationships are managed via **foreign keys** and **joins**, which become inefficient for deep/recursive relationships.
- Graph DBs make **n-hop traversal** faster and more expressive using direct references.

üìå **Real-world use cases**:
- Social Graphs (Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Recommendations (Netflix, Amazon)
- Fraud Detection (Financial institutions)
- Knowledge Graphs (Google Search)
- Route Planning (Google Maps)

## Core Graph Concepts

### üî∏ Nodes (Vertices)
Represent **entities**: users, items, articles, cities.

### üî∏ Edges (Relationships)
Represent **connections** between nodes.
- Can be **directed** (follows, purchases) or **undirected** (friendship).
- Can have **properties** (timestamp, weight, trust score).

### üî∏ Properties
Both nodes and edges can store metadata:
```json
User: {
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30
}

Edge: {
  "type": "FRIEND",
  "since": "2019-06-01"
}
```

### üî∏ Graph Types
- **Directed / Undirected**
- **Weighted / Unweighted**
- **Cyclic / Acyclic**
- **Dense vs Sparse**

## Data Modeling in Graph DBs

### üîß Steps to Model
1. Identify entities ‚Üí nodes
2. Identify relationships ‚Üí edges
3. Determine cardinality (1:1, 1:n, m:n)
4. Add direction to edges
5. Normalize vs denormalize properties

### ‚úÖ Example: Social Media App
```text
(User) --[FOLLOWS]--> (User)
(User) --[LIKES]--> (Post)
(Post) --[HAS_TAG]--> (Tag)
```

## Querying and Traversal Techniques

Graph traversal is the core of graph queries.

### üõ†Ô∏è Common Patterns
| Query Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| 1-hop | Who does Alice follow? |
| 2-hop | Who are friends of friends? |
| Path | What is the shortest path from A to B? |
| Cycle Detection | Are there fraud rings? |
| Pattern Match | Find users who like the same things as Alice |

### üîÑ Traversal Algorithms
- **DFS / BFS**: Basic exploration
- **Dijkstra**: Shortest path
- **A\***: Informed shortest path with heuristics
- **PageRank / HITS**: Ranking nodes
- **Connected Components**: Community detection
- **Cycle detection**: Detecting loops or rings

## Graph Algorithms for System Design

| Algorithm | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| BFS/DFS | Friend suggestion, graph traversal |
| Dijkstra / A\* | Route planning |
| PageRank | Content recommendation, influence scoring |
| Community Detection | Fraud clusters |
| Topological Sort | Task scheduling |
| Cycle Detection | Fraud ring detection |

## Graph DB Internals & Trade-offs

### Storage Models
- **LPG (Labeled Property Graph)**: Nodes/edges with labels and properties (Neo4j)
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**: Triple-based: subject ‚Üí predicate ‚Üí object

### Performance
- Constant-time traversal via pointer chasing
- Efficient for **relationship-heavy** datasets
- Not optimal for heavy aggregation (use hybrid approaches)

### CAP and Distribution
- Graph DBs usually **sacrifice consistency** (AP in CAP) to maintain traversal speed
- Native graph DBs can be harder to scale horizontally
- Sharding is hard due to tight coupling between nodes

## Graph-Based System Design Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Social Graph** | Friends, followers, suggestions |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Facts and relationships for semantic search |
| **Recommendations** | Users/products/movies as bipartite graphs |
| **Fraud Detection** | Identify abnormal cyclic patterns in transactions |
| **Navigation System** | Location graphs with Dijkstra/A\* |
| **Access Control** | Role inheritance and permission propagation |

## How to Present in Interviews

When discussing graph designs in interviews:

1. **Identify entities and relationships**
2. **Draw the graph schema** (whiteboard or explain in text)
3. **Justify graph DB over relational/NoSQL** (based on use case)
4. **Explain traversal strategy** (DFS/BFS, path matching)
5. **Discuss scale and performance** (partitioning, caching, replication)
6. **Consider alternate models** (hybrid SQL+Graph, etc.)
