# Types of Databases

## Relational Databases

Relational databases structure data into one or more tables of rows and columns, with a unique key identifying each row. Rows in a table can be linked to rows in other tables through foreign keys, establishing a relationship between them.

This structure allows relational databases to handle large amounts of structured data, enforce data integrity, and support complex queries and ACID transactions.

They use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining, manipulating, and querying data, making them highly versatile and widely used in various applications.

### Use cases

- **Enterprise Applications:** For managing customer data, inventory, employee records, and financial transactions, where data integrity and relationships are critical.

- **E-commerce Platforms:** Handling product catalogs, customer orders, and payment transactions, requiring complex queries and transaction processing.

- **Banking and Financial Services:** Managing accounts, transactions, and user data, where the ACID properties ensure the reliability and consistency of financial operations.

## Key Value Store


Key-value stores are NoSQL databases that store data as key-value pairs providing fast retrieval of values based on unique keys.

They are primarily used when the data model is based on key-value pairs and requires high scalability, availability and throughput.

However, they may not be the best fit for applications that require complex querying, data relationships, or strong consistency guarantees.

### Use cases

- **Session Storage:** Storing and managing user session information such as user preferences, shopping carts or authentication tokens in web applications.

- **Caching:** Implementing caching mechanisms to improve the performance of web applications by storing frequently accessed data in memory for rapid retrieval.

- **Real-time data processing:** Key-value stores can quickly store and retrieve data for real-time analytics, event processing, or message queues.

### Examples
- Redis
- DynamoDB

## Document Databases

Document databases, a subset of the broader NoSQL family, are designed to store, manage, and retrieve document-oriented information.

These databases handle data in a semi-structured format, typically JSON, XML, or BSON, allowing for a more flexible schema than traditional relational databases.

Document databases are particularly useful in scenarios where the data model evolves frequently, and where fast read and write performance is critical.

However, they may not be the best fit for highly structured data or complex transactions spanning multiple documents or collections.


### Use cases

- **E-commerce Platforms:** Storing product catalogs with diverse attributes, user reviews, and inventory data, allowing for flexible representation of product information.

- **Content Management Systems (CMS):** Ideal for managing articles, user profiles, and comments, where each piece of content can be stored as a document.

- **Real-Time Analytics and IoT:** Handling varied data structures generated by IoT devices and supporting real-time analytics on this data.

### Examples
- MongoDB, Couchbase, and Apache CouchDB

## Graph Databases

Graph databases are a type of NoSQL database that specialize in storing, managing, and querying complex networks of interconnected data.

They represent data as graphs, consisting of nodes (entities), edges (relationships between entities), and properties (information associated with nodes and edges).

By leveraging the graph structure, graph databases enable efficient traversal, querying, and analysis of interconnected data.

They are very useful in applications like social networks and recommendation engines.

### Use cases

- **Social Networks:** Managing user profiles and their connections, enabling features like friend recommendations and social graph analysis.

- **Recommendation Systems:** Analyzing customer preferences, product inventories, and purchase histories to generate personalized product or content recommendations.

- **Knowledge Graphs:** Building vast repositories of interconnected data for semantic searches, information retrieval, and decision support systems.

## Wide column stores

Wide-Column Stores represent a type of NoSQL database optimized for storing and querying large amounts of data across many machines.

They organize data into tables with a flexible and dynamic column structure. They are designed to handle large-scale, distributed data storage and provide high scalability and performance.

Their column-oriented architecture, flexible schema, and eventual consistency model make them well-suited for applications that require high write throughput and real-time data processing.

However, they may not be the best fit for use cases that require complex joins, strong consistency, or strict ACID transactions.

### Use cases

- **Web analytics and user tracking:** Ideal for capturing and analyzing event data in real-time, such as web analytics, user activity logs, and network monitoring.

- **Real-Time Analytics:** They can quickly aggregate and analyze data, making them suitable for dashboards, alerting systems, and operational analytics.
