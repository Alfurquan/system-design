# 🧭 Step-by-Step Guide to Mastering System Design Exercises from Chapter 6

## 🥇 Step 1: Work Backwards from the Problem

Before jumping into the solution:

- Break the problem into “what kind of system is this?”
- Ask:
  - Is this read-heavy?
  - Write-heavy?
  - Latency-sensitive?
  - Real-time?
  - Offline?
- Identify the core bottlenecks that require partitioning.

### 📌 Example: Twitter Feed System

- **Bottleneck?** Celebrities with millions of followers
- **Issue:** Write fan-out overload
- **Solution:** Needs partitioning and load balancing

---

## 🥈 Step 2: Choose a Baseline Partitioning Strategy

For every problem:

- Try **simple hash partitioning** by the primary key (e.g., user ID)
- Ask:
  - Does this lead to skew?
  - Query inefficiency?

Once you see the limits of basic partitioning, consider:

- **Range partitioning** (for sorted queries)
- **Composite keys** (e.g., `userID + timestamp`)
- **Salting/randomization**

---

## 🥉 Step 3: Draw the System

Use pen/paper or whiteboard to draw:

- `N` nodes/partitions
- Incoming keys/requests
- Arrows showing where each key would go

✅ Don’t worry about getting it perfect — focus on **tradeoff analysis**.

## 🏗 Step 4: Use This Thinking Template for Any System

| Question                            | What to Think About                              |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| What are we storing?                | Keys, values, metadata, timestamps, etc.         |
| What’s the access pattern?          | Point lookup, range scan, aggregation            |
| Which field makes a good partition? | Uniqueness, cardinality, balance                 |
| What’s the risk of skew?            | Hot users, time buckets, geo-locality            |
| What if we scale to 10x traffic?    | Will current partitioning still hold?            |
| How do we rebalance?                | Consistent hashing, directory server             |

## 📘 Example: Working Through One Exercise Together

### 🛒 E-commerce Order System

**Problem:** You’re storing customer orders and want to scale the system.

### Step 1: What are we storing?

```json
Orders → { order_id, customer_id, timestamp, items }
```

### Step 2: Access Patterns

- Lookup by `customer_id`
- Range queries by `timestamp`
- Aggregation: revenue per region or top customers

### Step 3: First Try: Partition by `customer_id`

✅ Pro: Customer lookups are fast  
❌ Con: Big customers might cause hot partitions

### Step 4: Alternatives

- Partition by `order_id`: more uniform, worse for customer queries
- Add **salt** to `customer_id`: spreads heavy customers
- **Composite key**: (`customer_id`, `order_id`) with hash partitioning

### Step 5: Think Scaling

- If traffic grows → use **consistent hashing** to minimize movement
- Use **secondary indexes** if queries go beyond partition key

✅ You just solved the partitioning logic for this use case!

## 🔁 Practice Loop (Recommended)

For each exercise:

1. Spend **20 minutes** on the partitioning decision alone
2. Don’t worry about the full system — just map **key → partition**
3. Validate:
   - How many keys go to each partition?
   - Where can it go wrong?
4. Reflect:
   - Did you improve the skew?
   - Is it still queryable?
