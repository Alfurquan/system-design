# ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

You are tasked with building a backend system for managing **customer orders**. The system needs to be distributed for **scalability** and **fault tolerance**.

### Key Goals:
- Support **high write volume** and **order lookup** by customer or order time.
- Enable **partitioned storage** and **indexing** for performance.

---

## ðŸš© Challenges

### Partitioning:
- Should you partition by **customer ID** or **order ID**?
- How do you handle **huge order volumes** for a few large customers?

### Efficient Querying:
- How do you query orders within a **time range** across all customers?

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Task

1. **What partitioning strategy would you use** to store order data?

2. **How would you handle high write volumes** and large customer datasets?

3. **How would you support efficient queries** by customer ID and order time?

4. **How would you ensure scalability and fault tolerance**?

## Solution

Lets first define the data model which we will be storing

```json
{
  "order_id": "ORD123456",
  "customer_id": "CUST789",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-30T12:30:00Z",
  "items": [
    {"sku": "SHOE001", "quantity": 1, "price": 2999},
    {"sku": "BAG002", "quantity": 2, "price": 1999}
  ]
}
```

### Partitioning Strategy
- **Partition by Customer ID**: This allows efficient lookups for all orders by a specific customer. It also helps in distributing the load evenly across partitions, especially if customers have varying order volumes.
- **Order ID Partitioning**: This could lead to hotspots if a few customers generate a disproportionate number of orders. It may also complicate queries that need to filter by customer.
We will use a composite partition key of `customer_id` and `order_id` to ensure that we can efficiently query by both customer and order. We will be using hash partitioning to distribute the data evenly across partitions.

For customers with large order volumes, I would implement salting to divide their orders across multiple sub-partitions, ensuring no partition becomes a bottleneck.

### Handling High Write Volumes
- **Sharding**: Use a sharded database architecture where each shard contains a subset of customers. This allows horizontal scaling as the number of customers grows.
- **Write Buffers**: Use write buffers or queues to handle bursts of incoming orders, ensuring that the system can absorb high write volumes without overwhelming the database.
- **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing for order inserts to reduce the number of write operations and improve throughput.

### Efficient Querying
- **Indexing**: Create secondary indexes on `customer_id` and `timestamp` to enable fast lookups and range queries.
- **Time Bucketing**: Store orders in time buckets (e.g., daily or hourly) to facilitate efficient range queries. This allows you to quickly retrieve all orders within a specific time range for a customer.
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data, such as recent orders or popular customers, to reduce database load and improve response times.

### Scalability and Fault Tolerance
- **Replication**: Use database replication to ensure data availability and fault tolerance. Each partition can have multiple replicas across different nodes to handle failures.
- **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing across partitions to ensure that no single partition becomes a bottleneck. This can be achieved through consistent hashing or dynamic partitioning strategies.
- **Monitoring and Auto-scaling**: Set up monitoring to track partition load and performance. Use auto-scaling to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic patterns, ensuring that the system can handle varying loads without downtime.
- **Data Migration**: Implement a strategy for rebalancing partitions when customer order volumes change significantly. This could involve moving data between partitions or creating new partitions as needed.
