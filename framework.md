# Frameworks for system design interviews

We can follow these steps to solve any system design problems

## Clarify requirements
 - **Functional:** What the system should do, functionality to support
 - **Non functional:** Requirements like scalability, latency etc

## Define core entities

## Define APIs or interface

## Dataflow

## High level design

## Deep dives

# Fundamentals to master

- **Storage**
- **Scalability**
- **Networking**
- **Latency, throughput and performance**: Mainly focus on capacity estimates, time for basic operation
- **Fault tolerance and redundancy**
- **CAP theorem**
